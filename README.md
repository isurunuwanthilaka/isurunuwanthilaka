### Hi there 👋

I am a passionate fullstack Software Engineer.

I code in Java (Springboot), React.JS, Golang and Python. Writing Microservices is my main task at work, apart from that Docker and Postgres play key role in my daily tasks. Designing is what I enjoy most.

I do many side projects :) in free time. 

When I am not coding , I do reading, meditation or over thinking about something - yeah, about anything.
