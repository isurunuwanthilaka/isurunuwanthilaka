### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate `Fullstack Software Engineer` from Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka .

I code in `Java` , `Javascript`, `Golang` and `Python`. Developing and maintaining `microservices` is my main task at work, also I use `Docker/Jenkins` for CI/CD and `Postgres/Oracle/Firebase` for databasing. Designing and learning new technologies is what I enjoy most. I do many side projects ðŸ˜‰ in my free time. 

When I am not sticking to a screen , I might be doing reading, meditation or over thinking about something - yeah, about anything.

I am blogging at [here](https://isurunuwanthilaka.github.io)
